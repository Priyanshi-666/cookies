1. Preheat oven at 170째C/340째F.
2. In a large bowl, add the room temp (or softened) butter. Add sugar and salt. Mix them using a spatula so that the sugar the fly out. Then switch to an electric mixer. Mix until creamy, pale and fluffy.
3. Add the yolk, cream and vanilla extract. Mix till combined.
4. Sift the cake flour and cornstarch in 2 batches. Fold in using a spatula. Sift the remaining dry ingredients until the flour disappear.
5. Transfer the dough into a piping bag. I am using 1M tip. Double up the piping bag if yours is thin like mine. A thin piping bag will cause breaking of the bag. Also it will ease your piping.
6. Bake in preheated oven at 170째C/340째F for about 15-18 min. For 15min, the cookies might be softer than 18min bake, so it really depending on how crispy you desire your cookies to be.
7. Let it cool completely.
8. Cookies are ready to serve.
